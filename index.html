I am a post-doc research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn, Germnay. 
In 2025, I will join Tel Aviv University as an Assistant Professor of Law.
<br>
<br>
I hold a JSD degree from <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/">Stanford Law School</a> in California. 
Previously I was a visiting scholar at the <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili">Information Law Institute</a> at New York University.
<br>
<br>
My research interests are the intersection of administrative law and decision-making and artificial intelligence, primarily via an empirical legal studies perspective.
